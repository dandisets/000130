description: This dataset contains sorted unit spiking times from a macaque performing
  a time-interval reproduction task. In the experimental task, the monkey was presented
  with two stimuli separated by a specific interval of time. The monkey then attempted
  to time their response such that the interval between the second stimulus and their
  response matched the interval separating the two stimuli. Neural activity was recorded
  from neural probes implanted in the dorsomedial frontal cortex.
